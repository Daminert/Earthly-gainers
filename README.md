# UX Case Study and Research

## Introduction

The UX (user experience) case study is currently the next stage in operation. In this phase, we aim to:

1. Examine companies that genuinely require these devices.
2. Determine what essential items can be obtained from a device after recycling.
3. Find companies that actively demand these recycled materials.
4. Look for businesses that offer incentives to customers for recycling materials.

The majority of users and customers, according to the feedback we've received, are motivated by incentives. This research will guide our product designers in making crucial decisions regarding the design of our product, including whether to create a single page or multiple pages. It will enable us to build a user-friendly website that addresses the needs and motivations of our users.

## Research Team

This research will be conducted by a dedicated team consisting of:

- **Chioma ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®, Product Manager**
